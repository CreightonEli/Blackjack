## Overview

I was scouring the internet for interesting API's I could use to make stuff with I came across the Deck of Cards API by Chase Roberts.
I thought it was so cool that I just had to use it for something, so I figured I'd "quickly" slap a Blackjack game together and that'd be that.
I used to think Blackjack was a simple game but now I know better. This took me the better part of 3 weeks to get to this point and I still feel like
there is more work to be done. As far as traditional Blackjack goes it's still a little barebones but the basic functionality is there for a fun game.
I'm happy with it as it is now and I hope you enjoy it too.
