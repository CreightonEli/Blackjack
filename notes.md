# Notes

## To Do:
- make blackjack game
    - create array for cards in flop
    - store the value of cards drawn and sum them up for game logic
    - make function to draw and add to array upon button press (hit me button)
    - create draw animation that sees cards flying in from top middle of screen with back up
    - make it so that cards flipping is an animation that auto completes after draw animation completes
    - add control panel at top as header to change settings or maybe game mode later on...
