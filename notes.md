# Notes

## To Do:
- make blackjack game
    - allow player to replay (shuffle cards and replay w/out using drawing a new deck and refreshing page)
        - hide stand button before player hits
        - maybe make hit button a play button to start
- create draw animation that sees cards flying in from top middle of screen with back up
- add control panel at top as header to change settings or maybe game mode later on...
