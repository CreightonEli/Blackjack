# Notes

## To Do:
- make blackjack game
    - dynamically change and render drawn cards
        - could make it so that a large number of cards are in HTML with empty classes from beginning and just iterate through card slots, removing the empty class from as many elements as there are cards drawn. Not very dynamic though.
    - store the value of cards drawn and sum them up for game logic
    - create draw animation that sees cards flying in from top middle of screen with back up
    - add control panel at top as header to change settings or maybe game mode later on...
